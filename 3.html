    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, <br>
        Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people,<br>
        it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.<br>
        The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,<br>
        which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.<br>
        This quickly became the most-used.<br>

        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,<br>
        lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser.<br>
        There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation,<br>
        so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. <br>
        They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language,<br>
        while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.<br>

    <p>동적으로 변경되는 콘텐츠를 만들고, 멀티미디어를 제어하고, <br>
    이미지에 애니메이션을 적용하는 등 거의 모든 작업을 수행할 수 있는 스크립팅 언어입니다.<br>
    (모든 것이 가능한 것은 아니지만 몇 줄의 JavaScript 코드로 달성할 수 있는 것은 놀랍습니다.)</p>
